\myheader{Research Interests}

\medskip

My research interests are in geometry, topology, and dynamical systems.
More specifically, I am interested in geodesic flows, geometric structures
on manifolds, convex projective structures, Hilbert geometries,
Patterson-Sullivan theory, ergodic theory, thermodynamic formalism,
symbolic dynamics, (nonuniformly) hyperbolic dynamical systems, coarsely
hyperbolic metric spaces, geometrically finite group actions, and
relatively Anosov representations.
