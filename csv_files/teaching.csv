Primary Instructor,Math 271,Mathematics for Elementary Teachers I,George Mason University,Fall,2020,,,"Virtual, synchronous",Active learning component. Managed and mentored two undergraduate learning assistants.,Collaborated with a faculty member to convert course to virtual format.
Primary Instructor and Course Creator,Math 440,"The Lab of Geometry at Michigan, LoGM",University of Michigan,Winter,2020,,,,"This course is a mathematics research experience course for undergraduates, with computational components.","Created the course in Fall 2019 as an extension of the existing Lab of Geometry program.
- Recruited and managed collaborators Samuel Hansen (University of Michigan mathematics librarian)
and Rachel Webb (University of Michigan mathematics PhD student)
- Designed a course in which students learned technical skills, presentation skills, writing skills, project
management skills, and more, in a project-focused course on topics in modern mathematics research
that are beyond the scope of the standard department curriculum.
- Supervised the development of original course material. Reviewed and assessed material developed
by collaborators for technical and presentation focused modules. Both independently and collabora- tively developed remaining original course material, including syllabi, assessments, rubrics, feedback and evaluation forms, and more. All material development informed by modern research on best practices in mathematics education."
