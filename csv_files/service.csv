Director,leadership,Lab of Geometry at Michigan (LoGM),,,July,2017,,,May,2020,,2017_07,,"LoGM is Michigan's chapter of the Geometry Labs United. Founded in January 2017, the goal of LoGM is to create avenues into mathematics research for enthusiastic undergraduates via mentoring, community, and visualization. Students in groups of 3-4 participate in semester-long research projects run by faculty with a graduate student assistant. At present, LoGM has consistently run 3-4 projects per semester. The program addresses high and increasing demand by undergraduates for mathematics research opportunities, which were previously limited to Michigan's extremely competitive and selective summer REU program. The program also addresses demand by post-docs and graduate students for structured mentoring opportunities by matching mentors with qualified and enthusiastic students.
As director of LoGM, I have contributed substantially to the program development. In the 6 semesters I have directed LoGM, there have been 22 projects, and I have worked with 61 faculty and graduate student mentors and 70 undergraduate researchers. I have:  Recruited, mentored, supported and managed research-active faculty leads who posed questions for undergraduate teams related to their current research.
Recruited undergraduate researchers and assigned students to projects based on appropriate qualifications after careful review in an application process.
 Developed application materials and collaborated with several members of the mathematics department to effectively and responsibly evaluate student candidacy.
 Successfully applied to the University of Michigan curriculum committee to make LoGM a standard course offering from the Michigan mathematics department.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
